# CPSC5910_Lab6
Sixth lab for CPSC 5091 Data Structures for the Computer Science Funamentals Certificate at Seattle University. In this lab we implemented a template for a MaxHeap using a vector as the underlying data structure. We also implemented heapsort as a static method and created tests to test all of the functionality.
